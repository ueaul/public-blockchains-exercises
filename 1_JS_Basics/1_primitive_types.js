////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Welcome to the 1st exercise sheet of Programming Fundamentals in JavaScript!
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// PS: I know I said the 1st exercise also in Part 0, but that does not count.

// Enough said. Let's begin with the basics of JavaScript!
// We will start with the "primitive types.""
// A primitive type (or simply a type) is a category af variables
// in a language that share a set of common features.

// I hope you don't get bored. If so, just continue with the exercises
// in the next file at your own pace. You will find the solutions in the
// folder called solutions. This time for real.

// EXERCISE 0. Primitive Types.
///////////////////////////////

// Not really an exercise, it is more a small warm up to recall the different
// primitive types in JavaScript and to get you familiar with ATOM Hydrogen.

// Create a variable named morph and assign a value to it for each
// primitive type in JavaScript. The typeof operator gives the type
// of a variable.

// Some operations may be allowed for a certain primitive type and raise
// an error for another one.

// Important! I am assuming you are using the Hydrogen package to
// run these exercise. If so, you may avoid declarig variables with let.
// This has the advantage that you can re-run the same command without
// throwing errorr such as  "variable already defined",
// This has also the disadvantage that the linter will complain about
// the variable not being defined. Let it complain, he is a grumpy old linter.

// Do you remember how to use Hydrogen? It is very easy:
// - to execute the line where the cursor is, press Ctrl-Enter.
// - to execute multiple lines at once, highlight them, and press Ctrl-Enter.

// Numbers.

// integer.
morph = 1;
console.log(typeof morph);
// It is good practice to always add the semicolon at the of a statement.

// Floating point
morph = 1.1;
console.log(typeof morph);
// Note Both floating point and integer numbers belong to the same primitive
// type: 'number'. Other programming language may distinguish different
// subtypes, such as positive-only, floating point, etc, to save space
// in memory. However, your life is easier, they are all numbers.

// Strings

morph = 'I morphed into a string.'
console.log(typeof morph);
// JavaScript is dynamically (or loosely) typed. This means that
// the type of a variable can change at run-time. Languages that are
// statically (or strongly typed) will throw an error if you attempt to
// change the type without calling a special conversion routine.

// A one-type character string is also a string. Other languages have
// the type 'char' for this special case, but not JS.
morph = 'A';
console.log(typeof morph);

// Booleans.
morph = true;
console.log(typeof morph);
morph = false;
console.log(typeof morph);

// Not much to say about booleans, right?

// Undefined
let iAmNotDefinedYet;
console.log(typeof iAmNotDefinedYet);
console.log(typeof undefined);
// If something does not exist or has not yet been initialized, its type
// is 'undefined'. We will come back with more examples to this later.

// There are other two important primitive types: 'object', and 'function'.
// We will learn more about those in the next exercises.

// EXERCISE 1. Computations.
////////////////////////////

// Perform the following computations and store the results in four
// separate variables named a, b, c, and d.
// Multiply these variables to obtain the size of the population
// of the city of Luzern as reported by Wikipedia Eng. as of 03.06.2020.

// a. Compute (18 + 107) / (5 * 25)

var a = (18 + 107) / (5 * 25);
console.log(a);

// b. Compute the square root of one million.

var b = Math.sqrt(1000000)
console.log(b);

// c. Take the remainder of the division betwen 123 and 9 squared, minus 1.

var c = 123 % 9 - 1
console.log(c);

// d. Take the integer part of the float number 2.123456789 (need to use Math).

var d = parseInt(2.123456789, 10);
console.log(d);

// Now compute:
console.log(a*b*c*d);

// EXERCISE 2. Variable Naming.
///////////////////////////////

// Assign the value of the previous computation to variable with a proper name.

// Long Hint. It is really important to name variables with meaningful names.
// I mean, not meaningful for you, such as the name of your best friend
// or of your dog, but meaningful with respect to the context of
// the computer program in which they are executed.
//
// For instance, you could name the variable in this exercise:
// the_population_of_Luzern_according_to_Wikipedia
// However, that would be impractically long. A better name would be:
// Luzern_Population
//
// However, you can do even better. In fact, every programming language
// has fixed conventions for variable naming. In JavaScript, variables
// should begin with a lower case letter and any following word should be
// merged in a "camel case" manner. That is: without seperating characters
// and with a upper case for the first letter of every next word. So:
// luzernPopulation
// is probably a good candidate. But the final choice is yours!
luzernPop = a*b*c*d;
console.log(luzernPop);

// EXERCISE 3. Random numbers.
//////////////////////////////

// a. Generate a random number between 0 and 1, and store its value
// in a variable (and pick a proper name for the variable!).
// Hint. The Math object is your friend.
rndmNumber = Math.random();

// b. Update the variable so that the value of the random number is
// between 0 and the one hundred thoudands.
rndmNumber = rndmNumber * 100000;
console.log(rndmNumber);

// EXERCISE 4. Conditionals.
////////////////////////////

// A small intro to conditionals, more on this later.
// Write a short code statement that compares the size of the population
// in Luzern computed in Exercise 1 with the random number you generated
// in Exercise 3. If the random number is larger than the population of
// Luzern print "Go Luzern!", if exactly equal print "Are we in the Matrix?",
// otherwise print "Few but good!"
// Hint: Use console.log to print.
if (luzernPop > rndmNumber){
    console.log("Go Luzern");
} else if (luzernPop == rndmNumber){
    console.log("Are we in the Matrix?");
} else {
    console.log("Few but good!")
}

// EXERCISE 5. String manipulation.
///////////////////////////////////

// a. Join together these two strings and assign the result to a new variable
// named finalStr.
str1 = "Always remember that you are absolutely unique.";
str2 = 'Just like everyone else.';

str3 = str1 + " " + str2;
console.log(str3)

// b. Did you remember to add a space between them?
// If so, how many characters is the final string?
console.log(str3.length)

// c. Did you know that you can also join strings and numbers together?
// Replace str2 with a new sentence that includes the total population count
// of the city of Luzern that you just computed. For example:
// "Just like other X persons in Luzern." (X to be replaced with the count)
// Then, join it with str1 and update finalStr.
// Important. String must end with a dot (needed for exercise below).


// d. Alternatively, you can specify strings using the backtick sign `
// which allows for in-string variable substitution.


// e. If you made it until now, you may prefer a more positive message
// in the finalStr variable. Extract a substring which contains only
// the first part.
// Hint: Use substring and the length property.
console.log(str3.substring(0, str1.length))

// f. Now shout it loud and make the it upper case.
// Hint: Use toUpperCase.
console.log(str3.substring(0, str1.length).toUpperCase())

// g. Let's be honest. An upper case sentence must end with an exclamation mark.
// Replace the dot at the end of the sentence with an exclamation mark.
console.log(str3.substring(0, str1.length - 1).toUpperCase() + "!")

// EXERCISE 6. Constants.
/////////////////////////

// You just unlocked a great insight with exercise 5, which is contained in
// the variable finalStr. You do not want anybody to change that string
// ever again, so you decide it to assign it to constant.
const myFinalStr = finalStr;
console.log(myFinalStr);

// Now try to change it to something else.
myFinalStr = 'something else';

// You should have seen error below. We will later learn that constants behave
// differently with objects, but for now you are done, you completed the first
// exercise sheet!

// Pat yourself on the back or ask the person to your right to do it,
// if that is appropriate.
